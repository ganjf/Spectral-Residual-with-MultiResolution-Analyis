# Spectral-Residual-with-MultiResolution-Analyis
!!ALGORITHM 
1\Luminance feature\Color feature\Direction feature;
2\Pyramiy of multiResolution;
3\Spectral residual with resolution pyramid;
4\add all components of different feature;
5\add different resolution saliency map of feature;
6\choose the best feature with kmeans ,judging from  the center of kmeans;
7\get the saliency map with kmeans gathering salient points;
